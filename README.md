# 7nm-FinFET-cells-layout
The project in advanced VLSI course is for creating the standard library of the cells and verfying the 7nm FinFET layout and schematic.  All of the cells are created side by side and no DRC errors occur.  All pins must be aligned horizontally as well, with uniform spacing. Therefore, The height of the p-diff are 3 fins and the height of the n-diff are also  3 fins.
